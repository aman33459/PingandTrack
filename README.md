Ping and Track, an android based application for tracking the location of a lost android device using SMS. The application locates device by sending a SMS to lost android device and in return receives the lost android device’s latitude and longitude. The application also provides the feature to block certain numbers at the lost android device’s end thus preventing the blocked users from receiving the lost android device’s location details.The Android Application is well suited for android devices having calling features. The seeking device registered in the database of the lost android device sends a SMS (which is a predefined attention word) to the lost android device (device whose location is to be tracked); the application then matches the contents of the SMS with the predefined attention word. If the SMS content matches with the predefined attention word, then the application retrieves the location details of the lost android device and sends the same.
